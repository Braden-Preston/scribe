Hell is a spiritual place of darkness, where people are cut off from the Lord – the Light of All Men.

Offspring of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?</strong>” (Matthew 23:33 MKJV) The scribes and Pharisees&nbsp;<strong><em>were</em></strong>&nbsp;in hell – otherwise, they could have escaped its condemnation – do you see?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So what happens to those who receive greater condemnation? They’ll have to face the greater consequences of their culpability, just as a criminal with a more severe offense serves a greater sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s an example the Lord gave:</p><p><br></p><p>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the powerful acts which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes! But I say to you,&nbsp;<strong><em>It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you</em></strong>” (Matthew 11:21-22 MKJV).</p><p><br></p><p>All will be humbled and corrected by God’s judgment, because turned from their sins and repentant. “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God” (Luke 3:5-6).</p><p><br></p><p>These aren’t just our thoughts – they’re the Word of God, which is all that matters.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Paul Cohen &amp; Victor Hafichuk</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.thepathoftruth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(224, 242, 254); color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">www.ThePathofTruth.com</a></p></div><div class="ql-clipboard" contenteditable="true" tabindex="-1"></div><div class="ql-tooltip ql-hidden"><a class="ql-preview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="about:blank"></a><input type="text" data-formula="e=mc^2" data-link="https://quilljs.com" data-video="Embed URL"><a class="ql-action"></a><a class="ql-remove"></a></div>`
